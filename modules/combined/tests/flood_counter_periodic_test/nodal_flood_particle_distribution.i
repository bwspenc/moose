# This test places a single large feature in the middle of a square domain.
# The domain is sized such that individual element areas are uniform and equal
# to 1.0. The feature is a circle with a radius of 10.0.
#
# The area of the feature is calculated to be:
# pi * 10^2 ~ 3.14e+2
#
# The mesh is very coarse for this simulation so the calculated result
# based on a flood value of 0.5 is 3.16e+2
